# About Vision Test Me

## Who?

This idea came to fruition after I, Anna Gregg, would explain the countless number of concussions that I or my teammates had received and the repercussions to my good friend Ben Byers. I play collegiate soccer in Colorado and Ben is a computer engineer with years and years of top level coding experience. We discussed how concussions can end atheltic and even scholastic careers. We both can up with the idea for this technology. 

## Why?

We created this technology to try and aid those afflcited by concussions. As a collegiate athelete who has suffered many concussions, I was always wondering if I had a concussion or just a headache from dehydration or any number of different things. I suffered a concussion that ended my sophomroe season. If this technology was available, I could have been diagnosed quicker and not been returned to play while still displaying symptoms that were just not apparent to my athletic trainer. This technology can help those possibly suffering from a concussion determine if they are showing symtoms of a concussion. From these results, any person afflicted can take further action with medical professionals with a more concrete idea if they are showing concussion symptoms. 

## When?

This technology was develoepd in the summer of 2018 and continues to be worked upon on a daily basis. 

## Objectives?

With this technology, we aim to lessen the reprecussions developed from concussions. We hope that this technology can identify normal or abnormal eye movements that help medical professionals determine if that person is able to return to any field they are participating in. This technology could lessen the serve impacts from returning to the field too soon.
