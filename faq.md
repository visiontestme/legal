# Frequently Asked Question 

Can this technology predict if I have a concussion?

No, this technology cannot predict if you have a concussion. It can determine if you have abnormal eye movements which can be indicative of a concussion but not always. 

How does this technology work?

This technology can track the movement of your pupils on y axis. The technology looks for any abnormal eye movement otherwise known as saccadic eye movement. The standard deviation is measured and calculated and from there we can determine if there is abnormal eye movement along the y axis. A person will want to have normal pursuit movements which is a smooth eye motion. 

What else can this technology do?

We are working on a function of the eye test to see if it can predict intoxication levels through observing eye movement. This technology is still being worked upon.
